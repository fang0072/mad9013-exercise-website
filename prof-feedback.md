# Professor Feedback

## Week 2B ----------------------

This is a tough exercise to start with. There are a fair amount of updates needed to make sure you're good to go for the next set of exercises:

- home page file should be `index.html`
- You are missing the <head> tag which should contain important meta data
- All visual content should be inside of the <body>
- <form> and <input> should not be used. All the Sign Up links should be an <a>. We will use styling to make it look like a button
- You <div class="main"> should be a <main>, which is the more appropriate semantic tag
- <figure> tags are only necessary when there is a visual caption. No <figure> tags are needed on this page
- <b> tags should not be used for headings. Use the appropriate heading tag. All major headings should be <h2> on the home page.
- You have the incorrect content in the first banner of the main. The heading should be "Community Feel. Professional Look." Make sure you have copied in the correct content from the content files.
- the <h1> should be wrapped around the <img> inside the <header>, the "Community feel" heading should be an <h2>
- <img> tags should all have a `src` and an `alt` attribute. Like this: <img src="./images/photo-1.jpg" alt="A photo of a nice dog">. `srcset` is the incorrect attribute to use in this case
- logo bar images should also be in an <ul> with <li> tags
- the logo bar, the "Design your brand..." content, and the "Join now..." banner should be in three separate <section> tags
- You should use a project file path for your images. See my example above. You have created a file path that references the exact location based on your computer, which will not work once this code is online or shared with me
- The white logo should be in the footer
- The logos in the header/footer should be wrapped in an <a> linking to the home page
- the <li> tags in the <footer> should be in an <ul>
- <p>Â©2021 Algonquin College</p> ==> <small>&copy; 2021 Algonquin College</small>
- the extra date and link to your email is not necessary in the footer, please remove


Here is how the base HTML set up should look:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Po\/lished+</title>
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <!-- nav content -->
    </header>
    <main>
        <!-- page content -->
    </main>
    <footer>
        <!-- outro content -->
    </footer>
</body>
</html>

- Background image URL paths are incorrect. Currently `./image/banners/soccer-banner-bw.jpg` but should be `../image/banners/soccer-banner-bw.jpg`. The `../` will go up out of the `css` folder before then going into the `image` folder.
- Typo in `.btn` ruleset: `border: .125rem soild #09a38c;` should be `border: .125rem solid #09a38c;`
- Button in CTA banner should be white
- "Join now..." banner should be in its own `<section>`
- You should avoid writing in all caps in HTML as it is bad for accessibility and SEO. Instead, you should write in normal sentence case and use `text-transform: uppercase;` to make the text appear all caps.
- Your `<a>` tags all have `href` pointing to pages like `first.html` or `second.html`. For now you should just put a placeholder `#`. In the future we will be making more pages but they will have more descriptive names such as `sign-up.html`.

- Make sure to review your CSS to insure it is neat and organized, including:
  - remove empty lines inside of CSS rules
  - there should be a space between the selector and the opening curly bracket `{`
  - there should be a space between each ruleset
  - double check indentation
- You should be using the colours and font (Ubuntu) provided in the exercise assets repo.
- `h5` should have a `border-bottom`
- `h1` and `h2` should have a normal font weight, not bold
- You should apply your default type styles directly to the tag selectors `h1` instead of classes as they are applied generally across the website.
- The CSS should all be done in the `css/main.css` file. That way the styles will apply to all of your pages
- Make sure to include the default `margin` reset code we worked on together in class!
- You should use the `type-scale.com` site to help generate your typescale
- For the `stylesheet.html` file, you do not need to put each heading into separate `<section>` and `<div>` tags. Some thing simple like whats below is enough.
  - The styling should be directly applied to the heading tags, not to a `div` around it

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-ca">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>Polished+</title>
  <meta name="handheldfriendly" content="true">

  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Ubuntu:400,400i,700" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>

  <div class="container-text">

    <h1>Heading 1</h1>
    <h2>Heading 2</h2>
    <h3>Heading 3</h3>
    <h4>Heading 4</h4>
    <h5>Heading 5</h5>
    <h6>Heading 6</h6>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit <a href="#">amet consectetur</a> adipisicing elit. In blanditiis a dolor quasi illo eius pariatur saepe quibusdam quisquam mollitia libero amet neque velit nisi aspernatur, tempora eos. Modi, odio?</p>
